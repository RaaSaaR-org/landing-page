# Claude Code Instructions for RaaSaaR

@README.md

## Project Overview
This is the RaaSaaR landing page - a professional platform bringing Robots as a Service to Saarland, Germany. The focus is on practical solutions for businesses and municipalities, addressing regional challenges.

## Key Principles
- **Professional and practical**: Content should be solution-oriented, not overly promotional
- **Regional focus**: Emphasize Saarland-specific advantages (DFKI, ZeMA, research ecosystem)
- **Bilingual**: German is primary language, English for international reach
- **Problem-solver positioning**: Address labor shortage, industry transformation, and municipal needs
- **Dual market**: Balance industrial (manufacturing, logistics) and municipal (cleaning, infrastructure) applications
- **RaaS accessibility**: Emphasize no capital investment, flexible scaling, full service model

## Target Audience
1. **Industrial companies**: 200+ businesses in Saarland (automotive, manufacturing, logistics)
2. **Municipalities**: Cities and communities needing automation for services

## Content Guidelines
- Use concrete, regional statistics (40,000 automotive jobs, 900+ AI researchers)
- Reference DFKI as birthplace of Industry 4.0
- Highlight Saarland's compact size (2,570 km²) as advantage
- Focus on workforce augmentation, not replacement
- Maintain professional tone - visionary but grounded in reality
