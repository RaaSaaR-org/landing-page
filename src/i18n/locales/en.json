    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "questions": {
      "what": {
        "q": "What exactly is EmAI?",
        "a": "EmAI is a platform for humanoid robotics that makes advanced automation accessible to companies of all sizes. We combine a simple management platform with a flexible rental model: you pay a monthly fee and receive humanoid robots including maintenance, updates, and support — without acquisition costs of €150,000+ per unit."
      },
      "why": {
        "q": "Why humanoid robots?",
        "a": "Humanoid robots take on tasks that previously only humans could perform. They work in existing environments without modification, use existing tools, and can be flexibly deployed. For manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing, they offer maximum flexibility with minimal adaptation of your processes."
      },
      "cost": {
        "q": "How does the cost model work?",
        "a": "You pay a monthly fee based on the number of robots and scope of deployment. Included are: the robots themselves, regular maintenance, software updates, technical support, insurance, and training. No hidden costs, no upfront investment. Exact terms are individually tailored to your needs."
      },
      "timeline": {
        "q": "How quickly can I use EmAI?",
        "a": "After a needs analysis, we create an individual plan. Typical setup times are 2-4 weeks. We accompany you through the entire process — from planning through installation to training your teams."
      },
      "jobs": {
        "q": "Doesn't robotics lead to job losses?",
        "a": "Given the labor shortage, robots fill gaps that can no longer be filled by humans. They take over repetitive, dangerous, or physically demanding tasks and enable employees to focus on more qualified activities. Our goal is to augment the workforce, not replace it."
      },
      "target": {
        "q": "Who is EmAI suitable for?",
        "a": "EmAI targets companies in three main areas: (1) Manufacturing — from SMEs to large production facilities for assembly, quality control, and material handling. (2) Logistics — for distribution centers and fulfillment centers. (3) Warehousing — for order picking, inventory management, and goods handling. The rental model makes robotics particularly accessible to mid-sized companies."
      },
      "technology": {
        "q": "What robot technologies does EmAI use?",
        "a": "We deploy the latest generation of humanoid robots developed for human collaboration. These robots navigate autonomously, recognize and grasp various objects, and learn new tasks quickly. Our platform coordinates deployment, monitors performance, and continuously optimizes operations."
      },
      "support": {
        "q": "What support do I receive?",
        "a": "EmAI service includes full support: needs analysis and conception, installation and integration, employee training, ongoing maintenance, problem support, regular updates, and continuous optimization. You have a dedicated contact person for all matters."
