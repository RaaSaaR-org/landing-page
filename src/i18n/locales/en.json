      },
      "cost": {
        "q": "How does the cost model work?",
        "a": "You pay a monthly fee based on number and scope of robot deployment. Included are: robots, maintenance, software updates, technical support, insurance, and training. Terms are individually tailored."
      },
      "timeline": {
        "q": "How quickly can deployment happen?",
        "a": "After needs analysis, we create an individual plan. Deployment typically occurs within 2-4 weeks – from planning through installation to training."
      },
      "jobs": {
        "q": "How does robotics affect jobs?",
        "a": "Robots fill gaps created by labor shortages. They take over repetitive or physically demanding tasks and enable employees to focus on more qualified activities."
