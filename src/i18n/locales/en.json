    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "questions": {
      "what": {
        "q": "What exactly is Robots as a Service?",
        "a": "Robots as a Service (RaaS) is a business model where you rent robotic solutions as a service instead of purchasing them. You pay a monthly fee and receive the robots including maintenance, updates, support, and insurance. Similar to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), you have no capital investment and always stay technologically up-to-date."
      },
      "why": {
        "q": "Why does RaaSaaR focus on Saarland?",
        "a": "Saarland offers the perfect combination: As the birthplace of Industry 4.0 (DFKI), the region has world-class research in robotics and AI. At the same time, local companies and municipalities face concrete challenges (labor shortage, industry transformation) that can be solved through robotics. At 2,570 km², Saarland is also an ideal test region for comprehensive robotics services."
      },
      "cost": {
        "q": "How does the cost model work?",
        "a": "You pay a monthly service fee based on the type and number of robots and the scope of deployment. There are no acquisition costs. The fee includes: the robots themselves, regular maintenance, software updates, technical support, insurance, and training for your employees if needed. The exact terms are individually tailored to your use case."
      },
      "timeline": {
        "q": "How quickly can I use RaaSaaR?",
        "a": "After an initial needs analysis (1-2 weeks), we create an individual implementation plan. Depending on complexity, simple applications can start within 4-8 weeks. More complex industrial integrations require 2-4 months. We accompany you through the entire process – from planning through installation to training your teams."
      },
      "jobs": {
        "q": "Doesn't robotics lead to job losses?",
        "a": "On the contrary: Given demographic change and the skilled labor shortage in Saarland, robots fill gaps that can no longer be filled by people. They take over repetitive, dangerous, or physically demanding tasks and enable employees to focus on more qualified activities. Our goal is to augment the workforce, not replace it – especially in a region with a shrinking working population."
      },
      "target": {
        "q": "Who is RaaSaaR suitable for?",
        "a": "RaaSaaR targets two main groups: (1) Industrial companies in Saarland – from SMEs to large operations in sectors like automotive, manufacturing, logistics, and metal processing. (2) Municipalities and communities – for applications like street cleaning, waste management, infrastructure monitoring, and public safety. The RaaS model makes robotics particularly accessible for smaller organizations that cannot afford high investments."
      },
      "technology": {
        "q": "What robotic technologies does RaaSaaR use?",
        "a": "We work with leading robotics platforms and develop our own solutions in cooperation with DFKI, ZeMA, and Saarland University. Depending on the use case, we deploy: humanoid robots for complex human-robot interaction, mobile autonomous robots (AMR) for logistics and transport, industrial robot arms for manufacturing and assembly, and specialized robots for cleaning and inspection. The technology is individually tailored to your needs."
      },
      "support": {
        "q": "What support do I receive?",
        "a": "The RaaSaaR service includes comprehensive support: Initial needs analysis and concept development, installation and integration into existing processes, training for your employees, ongoing technical maintenance, 24/7 support for problems, regular software updates, and optimization of robot performance based on collected data. You have a dedicated contact person and benefit from our regional network."
