    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "questions": {
      "what": {
        "q": "What is EmAI?",
        "a": "EmAI offers Robots as a Service: humanoid robots for rent with a monthly fee including robots, maintenance, updates, and support – without acquisition costs. Our software platform controls everything centrally."
      },
      "why": {
        "q": "Why humanoid robots?",
        "a": "Humanoid robots work in existing environments without modification, use existing tools, and can be flexibly deployed. They offer maximum flexibility with minimal adaptation of existing processes."
      },
      "cost": {
        "q": "How does the cost model work?",
        "a": "You pay a monthly fee based on number and scope of robot deployment. Included are: robots, maintenance, software updates, technical support, insurance, and training. Terms are individually tailored."
      },
      "timeline": {
        "q": "How quickly can deployment happen?",
        "a": "After needs analysis, we create an individual plan. Deployment typically occurs within 2-4 weeks – from planning through installation to training."
      },
      "jobs": {
        "q": "How does robotics affect jobs?",
        "a": "Robots fill gaps created by labor shortages. They take over repetitive or physically demanding tasks and enable employees to focus on more qualified activities."
      },
      "target": {
        "q": "Which organizations is EmAI suitable for?",
        "a": "EmAI targets companies and public sector organizations in three areas: manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing. The service model is particularly suitable for organizations wanting to automate without capital investment."
      },
      "technology": {
        "q": "What robot technology is used?",
        "a": "We deploy the latest generation of humanoid robots developed for human collaboration. Our software coordinates deployment, monitors performance, and continuously optimizes operations."
      },
      "support": {
        "q": "What support is included?",
        "a": "The service includes: needs analysis, installation, employee training, ongoing maintenance, technical support, updates, and optimization. You have a dedicated contact person."
